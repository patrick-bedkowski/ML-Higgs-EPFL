    A critical part of scientific discovery is the
    communication of research findings to peers or the general public.
    Mastery of the process of scientific communication improves the
    visibility and impact of research. While this guide is a necessary
    tool for learning how to write in a manner suitable for publication
    at a scientific venue, it is by no means sufficient, on its own, to
    make its reader an accomplished writer. 
    This guide should be a starting point for further development of 
    writing skills.
